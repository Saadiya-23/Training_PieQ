OOPS Feature :

Class - It defines the variables and the methods which is common to all the objects instantiated from it.

Object - It is an instance of the class. They can use the variables and methods of the class to store their values and to compute. A class can have many objects . 

Encapsulation - It is the binding of variables and methods as a single entity . A class binds the data and the method under a single entity . It allows allows the accesbility of the data and methods(public , private , protected)

Polymorphism - 'poly' means 'many' . It is the abilty of the method to take many forms . It is of two types : function overloading and overriding . There can be many functions with different arguments and datatypes but with the same function name  --> This property is known as function overloading . A child class can override a function which was dervied from the parent class.

Abstraction - It allows us to hide all the complex implementation of the program . It helps to show only the necessary part. It is obtained through abstract classes and interfaces.

Inheritance - A class can inherit another class allowing them to derive all the properties of that class thus promoting reusabilty . The inherited class can add more properties in addition to the parent class properties.
